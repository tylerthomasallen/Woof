[Woof Live](https://w00f.herokuapp.com/#/)

Woof is a reviews website for dogs, inspired by Yelp. It is built with Rails and PostgreSQL on the backend and React and Redux on the frontend. The project was designed and built in two-weeks and is my first full-stack project.


## Features

* Secure frontend to backend user authentication using BCrypt.
